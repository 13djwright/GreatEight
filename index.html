						<h3>Starting Out</h3>
						<p>The deck is shuffled and the top card is laid aside</p>
						<p>Each player draws a card and the game begins</p>
						<p>You draw a card and then discard a card</p>
						<h3>The Cards</h3>
						<p>There are 8 types of cards and each card has a special effect. They are listed as follows:</p>
						<p>1: A player who discards this card chooses another player and guesses what card is in his/her hand. If the player guesses correctly, the target player is eliminated.</p>
						<p>2: A player who discards this card chooses another player and looks at his/her hand.</p>
						<p>3: A player who discards this card chooses another player with whom to compare hands. The player whose card has the lower value of the two is then eliminated. The cards are not shown to any other players.</p>
						<p>4: A player who discards this card cannot be targeted by the effects of any other playerâ€™s cards until his/her next turn.</p>
						<p>5: A player who discards this card chooses another player to discard his hand and re-draw.</p>
						<p>6: A player who discards this card chooses another player and the two players trade hands.</p>
						<p>7: A player whose hand contains both this card and a 5 or 6 must discard this card. It has no other effects.</p>
						<p>8: A player who discards this card is eliminated.</p>
						<h3>How to Win</h3>
						<p>There are two ways to win:</p>
						<p>Last one standing: if all other players are elimated you win</p>
						<p>Player with highest card: If the deck runs out of cards, everyone in play compares their last cards. The player with the highest card wins.</p>
